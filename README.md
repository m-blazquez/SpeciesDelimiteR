*SpeciesDelimiteR* is an R package designed to streamline species
delimitation analyses. The package provides a toolkit for taxonomists to
make informed decisions about species boundaries.

## Features

- **Input preparation:** Functions to prepare data for widely used
  species delimitation algorithms, such as ASAP, GMYC, and bPTP.

- **Output parsing:** Functions for parsing the results of these
  algorithms.

- **Integrate results:** Combines the outputs of multiple delimitation
  methods, along with additional user-provided data (e.g., morphology,
  geography), into a single, cohesive dataframe.

- **Data visualization:** Visualizations to help users compare species
  delimitation results and choose on consensus species.

- **Reporting:** Summarizes key data points for easier integration into
  scientific papers.

## Installation

*SpeciesDelimiteR* is still on early development, and should not be used
yet.
