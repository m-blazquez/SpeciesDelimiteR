## Features

- **Input preparation:** Functions to prepare data for widely used species delimitation algorithms, such as ASAP, GMYC, and bPTP.

- **Output parsing:** Functions for parsing the results of these algorithms.

- **Integrate results:** Combines the outputs of multiple delimitation methods, along with additional user-provided data (e.g., morphology, geography), into a single, cohesive dataframe.

- **Data visualization:** Visualizations to help users compare species delimitation results and choose on consensus species.

- **Reporting:** Summarizes key data points for easier integration into scientific papers.


## Installation

*SpeciesDelimiteR* is still on early development, and should not be used yet.
